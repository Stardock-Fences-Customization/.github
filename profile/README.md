## What is Stardock Fences?

**Stardock Fences** is a powerful and highly popular desktop enhancement utility for Windows, specifically designed to automatically organize and manage the clutter of icons on your desktop. It groups your shortcuts, files, and folders into manageable, customizable, and resizable shaded areas known as "Fences." This innovative approach transforms a chaotic desktop into a neatly organized workspace, significantly improving productivity and visual clarity.

Unlike manual organization, Fences can automatically sort icons into categories based on file type, name, or other properties. A simple double-click on the desktop can hide or show all your fences, giving you an instant clean slate when needed. For users with multiple monitors or complex workflows, Fences provides unparalleled control over the desktop environment, making it an essential tool for power users and anyone seeking a more efficient and aesthetically pleasing desktop experience. Its seamless integration with Windows and low resource footprint make it a reliable and trusted solution for desktop management.
